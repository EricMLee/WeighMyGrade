# WeighMyGrade
# This is a website for students whose teachers don't weigh stuff on canvas. 
# Simply add new items and put a weight and the grade you received on the assignment. The website will tell you, your current grade in the class and how much more of the class is left. If you have any extra credit assignment, select extra credit on the drop-down menu and the website will take in account of any extra credit.
